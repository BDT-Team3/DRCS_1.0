# Important

On the evening of 30 april i made some important changes to the code: i realised that in the same for loop we were doing things like fetching the image, but at the same time processing the macroareas, saving the data to dict, recreating the macros for sanity check and now I was going to add db saves to each iteration. I therefore split the programme into two in the image fecthing, modification and compression and sending to kafka + programme 2 simply the part up to the database.  Since I'm an idiot and forgot to pull before making changes, now it's a mess to update the repo so I made another one just in case.
